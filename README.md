Noti-Fish Connect App install for iOS
(must have developer mode turned on, see [https://noti.fish](https://104.198.247.136/?page_id=212) for how to try and turn it on)

rather than try and install the package using github online, visit this page with you apple smartphone
and click this link:
itms-services://?action=download-manifest&url=https://github.com/morsbenj/Noti-Fish-Connect-iOS-Download/raw/main/manifest.plist

As of now, the iOS version of the app is not able to 'roam' where the smartphone should be able to scan and connect
to other notifishes on the same network once you have it set up, and the app runs in the background, but this feature
is essentially blocked by the newest iOS restrictions
